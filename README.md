# 🧠 ONESHOT3D

**ONESHOT3D** is a browser-based AI tool that converts any single 2D image into a 3D model using **TensorFlow.js** and **Three.js** — all running client-side. It brings real-time, mobile-friendly, interactive 3D model generation from photos.

## 🌟 Features

- 🖼️ Upload any 2D image (face/object)
- 🤖 AI-based depth estimation via TensorFlow.js
- 🧱 Dynamic 3D model generation using Three.js
- 🔄 Rotate, zoom, and view models in 360°
- 📱 100% browser-based and mobile-ready

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- TensorFlow.js (AI depth prediction)
- Three.js (3D rendering)
- Mobile-first responsive design

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Open the app in your browser
2. Upload a photo
3. Wait a few seconds while the model generates
4. Explore the resulting 3D model interactively
